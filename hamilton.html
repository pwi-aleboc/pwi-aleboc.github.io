                <p>Margaret Heafield Hamilton (born August 17, 1936) is an American computer scientist, systems engineer, and business owner. She coined the term "software engineering". Hamilton was Director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for the Apollo space program. In 1986, she founded Hamilton Technologies, Inc., in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around the Universal Systems Language based on her paradigm of Development Before the Fact for systems and software design.</p>

                <p>Hamilton has published over 130 papers, proceedings, and reports about the 60 projects and six major programs in which she has been involved.</p>
                    
                <p>On November 22, 2016, Hamilton was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US President Barack Obama for her work leading the development of on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo Moon missions.</p>

                <p>Margaret Heafield was born on August 17, 1936, in Paoli, Indiana, to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (n√©e Partington). After graduating from Hancock High School in 1954, she studied mathematics at the University of Michigan in 1955 and earned a BA in mathematics with a minor in philosophy from Earlham College in 1958.</p>

                <p>She briefly taught high school mathematics and French upon graduation, in order to support her husband while he worked on his undergraduate degree at Harvard University. She moved to Boston, Massachusetts, with the intention of doing graduate study in abstract mathematics at Brandeis University. She cites Florence Long, the head of the math department at Earlham College, as helping with her desire to pursue abstract mathematics and become a mathematics professor. She had other inspirations outside the technological world, including her father (a philosopher and poet), and her grandfather (a school headmaster and Quaker minister). She says these men inspired her to a minor in philosophy.</p>

                <p>In 1960 she took an interim position at MIT to develop software for predicting weather on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers (at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC) for professor Edward Norton Lorenz in the meteorology department. Hamilton wrote that at that time, computer science and software engineering were not yet disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience.</p>
